## SequelOrm
Lightweight ORM.
- ï»¿SqlServer is currently the only supported database provider; this implementation was tested on version 2016. Support for PostgreSql and MySql are actively WIP.
- Parent-to-child foreign key convention is {ParentTypeName}_{idColumn} (e.g. Person {Id, Name, List(Of Phone)} => Phone {Id, Person_Id, PhoneNumber}).
- Supports 1 : many (e.g. 1 Person can have many Phones); the rest, as well as Logging, Caching and Transaction Isolation Levels, are actively WIP and will be available in the next few weeks.
- Direct support for Enum types is now available.
- Picks up non read-only properties only, and ignores RowVersion property if it doesnt exist.
- Finally, you may need to install appropriate Sql Clients or Providers from nuget.org, e.g. System.Data.SqlClient.

C#:
```csharp
using iNovation.Code;

// prerequisites
SupportedDbProvider provider = SupportedDbProvider.SqlServer; // others are WIP
string connectionString = "my connection string";

// the sync version
IOrm orm = SequelOrm.GetInstance(provider, connectionString);

// create a Person object
List<Phone> amyPhoneNumbers = new List<Phone> { new Phone { PhoneNumber = "01 001 AMY" } };
Person amy = new Person { Name = "Amy", Phones = amyPhoneNumbers, Account = AccountType.Checking };

// create a Person record
Person created = orm.Create<Person>(amy);

// find records of Person by sepcified conditions - the paged version
Condition condition = new Condition { Column = "PhoneNumber", SqlComparison = SqlComparisonOperator.SqlEquals, Value = "01 001 AMY" };
Page<Person> sought = orm.FindByPaged<Person>(new List<Condition> { condition }, 1, 10);
// retrieve the results by
List<Person> found = sought.Records;


// for the async version
IOrmAsync ormAsync = SequelOrmAsync.GetInstance(provider, connectionString);

// just call the async version of the methods, e.g.
Person createdByAsync = await ormAsync.CreateAsync<Person>(amy);


// please read the individual classes' documentations for important information.

// the above is based on these entities:

using iNovation.Code;

public class Person {
public int Id { get; set; }

[SqlType("NVARCHAR(100)")]
public string Name { get; set; }
public List<Phone> Phones { get; set; } = new List<Phone>();

[EnumStorage(EnumStorageType.String)]
public AccountType Account {get; set;} = AccountType.Checking;

public override string ToString()
{
    return Name + " (Id: " + Id + ")";
}

public enum AccountType
{
	Savings = 0,
	Current = 1,
	Checking = 2
}

public class Phone {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int Person_Id { get; set; }
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
    public override string ToString()
    {
        return PhoneNumber;
    }
}
```
